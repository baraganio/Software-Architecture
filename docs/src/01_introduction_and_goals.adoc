* Pablo Fernando Urones Clavera

It consists of an application in which users can register and enter to play the quiz game.


=== Requirements Overview

.High level Requirements
* The system will have at least one web frontend deployed and access will be through the Web.
* Users will be able to register in the system and consult the history of their participation in the system: number of games, number of correct/failed questions, times, etc.
* Questions will be automatically generated from Wikidata data.
* Questions must be answered within a given time limit.
* Each question will have one correct answer and several incorrect or distracting answers. Both the correct and incorrect answers will be generated automatically.
* The system will allow access to user information through an API.
* The system will allow access to the information of the questions generated through an API.



=== Quality Goals

|Goals|Details
| _Performance_ | _We are going to need the application to have a good performance since we are going to make several calls and we need that these calls do not take too much time for the system to be efficient and dynamic during its use_ 
| _Usability_ | _The use of the application must be an intuitive and simple process for the client user_
| _Maintainability_ | _We will try to take care of the architecture of the application so that functionality can be added, modified or removed with as few changes as possible_
| _Testeability_| _Our application may also be testable, that is, it will be subjected to a series of unit tests that we will perform to ensure proper operation of the system, in addition to identifying small errors and being able to correct them in such a case_
