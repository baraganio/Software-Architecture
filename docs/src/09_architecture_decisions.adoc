.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

|====
| Decision | Consequences | Risks
| Use of React.js | - Facilitates the development of user interfaces.
                  - React.js is a widely popular library in the development community.
                  - Improves the efficiency of frontend development. | - Limited experience with React.js.
                                                               - Possible learning curve for the team.
| Use of JavaScript | - Team's prior knowledge in JavaScript.
                     - Extensive support and resources available.
                     - Suitable language for frontend and backend development. | - Limitations in compile-time error detection.
                                                               - Potential challenges in performance for large projects.
| Use of MongoDB | - Flexible schema and horizontal scalability.
                 - Widely used in modern applications.
                 - Compatibility with unstructured data.
                 - Already implemented in user registration and login. | - Not familiar with NoSQL databases.
                                                    - Possible learning curve.
| Use of Docker | - Containerization that facilitates deployment and scalability.
                 - Consistent environment in development and production.
                 - Streamlines dependency management. | - Potential initial complexity in Docker configuration.
                                                      - Requires additional learning resources.
| Use of Bootstrap | - Simplifies and accelerates the development of responsive and mobile-first web applications.
                   - Provides a wide range of pre-designed components and styles.
                   - Offers extensive documentation and community support. | - Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Bootstrap.
